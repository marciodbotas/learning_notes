Why is Storytelling so powerful? And how do we use it to our advantage? Presentations expert David JP Phillips shares key neurological findings on storytelling and with the help of his own stories, induces in us the release of four neurotransmitters of his choice. Learn more in this 2nd TEDxStockholm talk of David's.

David JP Phillips is an international speaker, author and coach in Modern Presentation Skills. His training and material are based on neuroscience and biology which makes his deliveries very hands on, practical and motivational. He is best known for his seminar How To Avoid Death By PowerPoint, delivered at TEDxStockholm in 2015.

How can you be tricked or convinced by story? It all comes to emotional investiment.The more emotionally invested you are in anything in your life the less critical and the less objectively observant you become. Like when in love, you brain is full of hormones that hijack your frontal cortex

The storytelling can help releasing hormones and neurotransmitters, just like falling in love does. 

## Dopamine

Some of the good hormones are dopamine which the effects on your brain are Focus, Motivation, better Memory.

The interview story takes place, an story that intends to generate dopamaning by:

* Building suspense
* Then lauching a Cliff-hanger
* Per definition, all storytelling is dopamine-creating

## Oxytocin

This hormone makes one to turn more generous, trust more, and bonding to the one telling the story

And then comes the very sad history about the lost of a pregnancy and the desappoitment of a little brother, which turns to be the story of the teller

The higher levels of oxytocin make you fell more humam, fell like bondig and relaxed

In order to do tha, you need to create:

* Empathy

## Endorphine

You create this hormone by making people laugh, and the outcome is that people become more creative, they become more relaxed, and again they become more focus

## When Cortisol and Adrelin takes place

In high concentration of the given hormones you can fell:

* Intolerant
* Irritable
* Uncreative
* Critical
* Memory impaired
* You take Bade decisions

Many times in a work place meeting, these guys can be working against you. 

## Functional storytelling 

* Understand that you are a storytelling by birth
* Start writting down your story, so you become aware of then
* Index those stories in a way that you have stories that make people laugh ( Endorphine), and stories that make people feel empathy (Oxytocine)

* Next time you step in a meeting, pick one of your stories and use it to create those effects you want people feel .
